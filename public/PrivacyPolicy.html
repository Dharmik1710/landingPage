    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="mt-3">Your privacy is critically important to us. At LegalMind, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we
        collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>
      <li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
      </li>
      <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information you give us is shared publicly (or
        kept
        private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.</li>
      <li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>
      <li>We take the privacy and confidentiality of your work seriously and aim to make sure only the people who see
        your
        work are people who you want to see it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        <h5>1. Who are we and what this policy covers?</h5>
        <p>We are the people behind LegalMind that delivers a variety of
          services
          designed to allow the legal industry take full
          advantage of the power and promise of the technological advancements. This Privacy Policy applies to
          information
          that
          we
          collect about you when you use our website and any other service that is offered by LegalMind.</p>
        <p>Also, our website contains links to websites operated by third parties. If you’d like to use such third party
          websites,
          please keep in mind that when you interact with them you may provide information about yourself to those third
          parties.</p>
        <p>We don’t own or control these third parties and they have their own rules about collection, use and sharing
          of
          information. LegalMind will not be responsible for privacy practices or policies of such third party websites.
          Please
          check with those sites to determine their privacy policy.</p>
        <p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our website, web app and other products and services
          collectively as
          “Services.” Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices
          that you
          have
          with respect to that information. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>2. Information we collect:</h5>
        <p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so– for example, to provide our Services, to
          communicate
          with you, or to make our Services better. We collect information in two ways: if and when you provide
          information to
          us,
          and automatically through operating our services. Let’s go over the information that we collect:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li>
            <h5>2.1 Information you provide to us:</h5>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
              <li>
                <b>Basic Account Information:</b>
                <p>We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account.
                  For
                  example, we
                  require individuals who sign up for a LegalMind.tech account to provide a username and email
                  address–and
                  that’s it.
                  You
                  may provide us with more information–like your name–but we don’t require that information to create
                  your
                  account.</p>
              </li>
              <li><b>Transaction and Billing Information:</b>
                <p>If you buy a subscription to a LegalMind's plan you will provide additional
                  personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as
                  your name,
                  credit/debit card information, and contact information.</p>
              </li>
              <li><b>Communications with Us:</b>
                <p>You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our
                  engineers about a support question. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, or otherwise,
                  we store a
                  copy
                  of our communications as permitted by applicable law.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>2.2 Information we collect automatically:</h5>
            <p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
              <li><b>Log Information:</b> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers,
                mobile
                devices, and
                servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers,
                language
                preference,
                the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log
                information when you
                use
                our Services–for example, when you are navigating on our website.</li>
              <li><b>Usage Information: </b>We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we
                collect information
                about
                the actions that users perform on a site–in other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a
                site (e.g.,
                [legalmind.tech username] deleted “[title of user]” at [time/date]). We also collect information about
                what happens
                when
                you use our Services (e.g., page views, searches, button clicks) along with information about your
                device (e.g.,
                name
                of
                cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide
                our Services to
                you,
                as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.</li>
              <li><b>Location Information:</b> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP
                address. We collect
                and
                use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain
                geographic regions.</li>
              <li><b>Information from Cookies & Other Technologies:</b>A cookie is a string of information that a
                website stores on a
                visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor
                returns. Pixel tags
                (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and e-mails. LegalMind uses
                cookies and other
                technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for
                our Services,
                as
                well as track and understand e-mail campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>3. How we use information?</h5>
        <p> We use information about you as mentioned above and as follows:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
          <li>To provide our Services–for example, to set up and maintain your account, or charge you for any of our
            paid
            Services;</li>
          <li>To further develop our Services–for example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or
            will help
            them to be more efficient and productive;</li>
          <li>To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us
            improve
            our
            Services and make them easier to use;</li>
          <li>To monitor and protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and
            other illegal
            activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of LegalMind;</li>
          <li>To communicate with you about offers and promotions offered by LegalMind and others we think will be of
            interest
            to
            you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on LegalMind and our products.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>4. Sharing Information</h5>
        <p>We do not sell our users’ private personal information. We share information about you in the limited
          circumstances
          spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
          <li>
            <b>As Required by Law:</b> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or
            other
            governmental request
          </li>
          <li><b>With Your Consent:</b>We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For
            example, we
            may
            share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so</li>
          <li><b>Published Support Requests:</b>And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one
            of our feedback
            mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your
            request or
            to
            help us support other users.</li>
          <li><b>Business Transfers:</b> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all
            or a portion of
            our
            business by another company, or in the unlikely event that LegalMind goes out of business or enters
            bankruptcy, user
            information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of
            these
            events
            were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving
            your
            information
            may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
          <li><b>Third Party Vendors:</b>We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know
            information
            about
            you in order to provide their services to us. This group includes vendors that help us provide our
            Services to you
            (like
            payment providers that process your credit and debit card information) and those that help us understand
            and enhance
            our
            Services (like analytics providers). We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share
            information
            with them.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>5. Security</h5>
        <p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against
          unauthorized
          access,
          use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>6. Choices</h5>
        <p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li><b>Limit the Information that You Provide:</b>
            If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide any optional
            account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that
            if you
            do
            not provide this information, certain features of our Services may not be accessible.
          </li>
          <li><b>Opt-Out of Electronic Communications:</b> You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us.
            Just follow the
            instructions in those messages. If you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you other
            messages, like
            those
            about your account and legal notices.</li>
          <li><b>Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies:</b> At this time, LegalMind does not respond to “do not track”
            signals across all
            of
            our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies
            before using
            LegalMind’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of LegalMind’s websites may not function
            properly
            without
            the aid of cookies.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>7. Other things you should know(Keep Reading)</h5>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li>
            <h5>7.1 Third Party Software and Websites</h5>If you’d like to use third party software with our Services,
            please keep in mind that when you interact with them
            you
            may provide information about yourself to those third parties. We don’t own or control these third parties
            and
            they
            have
            their own rules about collection, use and sharing of information. You should review their rules and policies
            when
            installing and using third party software.
          </li>
